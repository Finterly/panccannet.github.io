# PancCanNet Project

The aim of this project is the creation of a biological pathway community portal (PancCanNet) as a unified knowledge base for pancreatic cancer. The portal enables expert clinical researchers (medical and scientific) to add and curate pathway content and allows programmatic access for downstream knowledge integration, data analysis, and data visualization. PancCanNet provides a resource for determining the functional impact of multi-omics experimental data with the aim to understand the mechanisms of treatment resistance, discover novel biomarkers and develop personal treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients.

### Pathway collection

The [PancCanNet pathway portal](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:PancCanNet) is maintained on the community curated pathway database [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/) and currently contains xx pathways. 

If you are interested in joining our intiative and contribute to the pathway collection or request pathways to be added, please do not hesistate to contact us!
